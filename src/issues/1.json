LinkedIn has a process called 'External Library Request (ELR)' to handle it. It can currently handle Java, JavaScript, C++, Python, and iOS libraries. The article describes how does the process work for Java. They use Apache Ivy to record dependencies. What I was missing is the process for upgrading these libraries and removing them when they are not used any more.",
